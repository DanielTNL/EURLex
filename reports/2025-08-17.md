- The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final draft Implementing Technical Standards (ITS), amending the Implementing Regulation on the benchmarking of credit and market risk for the 2026 exercise.
- The most significant change is in the area of market risk, where the EBA is proposing to restrict the data collection to the information on the alternative standardised approach (ASA) to be provided by those banks that were granted the internal model approval.
- In the area of credit risk, the EBA is suggesting only minor changes.

- How does environmental, social and governance regulation of banks affect capital provision to the sustainability transition?
- As ambitious sustainability targets face funding challenges, the financial sector is tasked with channeling more private capital into sustainable investments.
- However, scaling sustainable technologies often requires investment in non-ESG-compliant assets.
- The mobility transition to electric vehicles, for example, demands increased supply of battery raw materials like Lithium, Cobalt, Manganese, and Nickel.

- Add full abstract text in one paragraph.This paper examines how the ECB’s 2022–2023 interest-rate hikes affected euro-area banks’ economic net worth and vulnerability to deposit runs.
- Drawing on granular, confidential data for 139 banks, we estimate each bank’s economic net worth and find that unrealised losses on loans and bonds averaged around 30 per cent of equity.
- By September 2023, however, roughly half of these losses had been offset by gains from the deposit franchise and interest-rate swaps.
- We develop a theoretical framework linking banks’ economic net worth and deposit-rate setting to depositor behaviour and run incentives.

- This box examines euro area household perceptions of rising defence spending, a trend reinforced by EU governments’ commitments at recent security discussions.
- According to the May 2025 ECB Consumer Expectations Survey, 81% of households anticipate increased defence spending within the next year.
- Public debt is seen as the most likely source of financing, followed by cuts in other spending and tax hikes.
- Households predict a slight increase in inflation in response to higher defence spending, while their expectations on growth are more varied.

- This article presents evidence from transactions data reported under the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR).
- Its aim is to assess the information content of euro area inflation-linked swap rates as measures of inflation compensation.
- It finds that both the breadth and the depth of overall activity have increased notably.
- The process of price discovery resulting from trading activity appears healthy on aggregate, and the sectoral composition of activity has shifted towards counterparties that can be deemed more responsive to changes in the inflation outlook.

- EU government spending on defence is expected to increase in response to heightened geopolitical tensions.
- This increase underpins efforts towards reaching a higher NATO defence spending commitment, as agreed at the NATO summit of 24-25 June.
- This box explores the implications for the euro area baseline projections and the risks around the baseline, as reflected in the June 2025 Eurosystem staff macroeconomic projections.

- The European Banking Authority (EBA) today published its final Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) specifying what constitutes an “equivalent legal mechanism” for unfinished property exposures under the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR).&nbsp;These RTS are part of the first phase of the EBA’s roadmap for implementing the EU Banking Package and take into account the stakeholders’ feedback, including targeted amendments to ensure both prudential soundness and practical applicability across the EU.

- Do climate stress tests affect bank credit supply to brown firms?
- Using a difference-in-differences approach and detailed data on individual bank loans in the euro area, this paper provides novel evidence on the effects of the ECB’s 2022 climate risk stress test.
- Despite no capital implications or public disclosures, participating banks significantly reduced credit to greenhouse gas-intensive industries relative to nonparticipants.
- Among affected firms, smaller borrowers were more negatively impacted.

- We introduce an estimated medium scale Heterogeneous-Agent New Keynesian model for forecasting and policy analysis in the Euro Area and discuss the applications of this type of models in central banks, focusing on two main exercises.
- First, we examine an alternative scenario for monetary policy during the early 2020s inflationary episode, showing that earlier hikes in interest rates would have affected more strongly households at the lower end of the wealth distribution, whose consumption our model suggests was already depressed relative to the rest of the population.
- To provide intuition for this result, we introduce a new decomposition of the effects of monetary policy on consumption across the wealth distribution.
- Second, we show that introducing heterogeneous households does no

- In modern macroeconomics, the marginal propensity to consume out of transitory income shocks is a central object of interest.
- This paper empirically explores a parallel concept in banking: the marginal propensity to lend out of unsolicited deposit inflows (MPLD).
- Using county-level dividend payouts as an instrument for deposit inflows, I estimate the MPLD for U.S.
- banks and show that before QE, the average bank operated “hand-to-mouth” — it transformed approximately every dollar of deposit inflow into new loans, consistent with tight liquidity constraints.
