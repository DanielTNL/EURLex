**[1] [The cost channel of monetary policy: evidence from euro area firm-level survey data](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3097~5b10420116.en.pdf)**

- This paper explores empirically the cost channel of monetary policy transmission during the recent period of monetary policy tightening in the euro area.
- We combine unique data on firms’ selling price expectation from the Survey on the access to finance of enterprises (SAFE), information on firms’ borrowing from the euro area-wide credit register (AnaCredit) and ECB monetary policy surprises.
- Firms revise upwards their one-year-ahead selling price expectations following monetary announcements in a tightening cycle and this effect increases in firms’ working capital exposure.
- The paper provides supportive evidence on the existence of a cost channel of monetary policy, adding to our understanding of monetary policy transmission to firms in the euro area.

**[5] [Supply shocks and inflation: timely insights from financial markets](https://www.ecb.europa.eu//pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp3096~9f5149ca8e.en.pdf)**

- We introduce a mixed-frequency model that identifies the impact of supply shocks on inflation in the United States in real time.
- The model decomposes weekly movements in inflation-linked swap rates—market-based inflation expectations—and isolates three supply shocks: global value chain disruptions, energy supply shocks, and domestic supply constraints, separating them from demand-driven factors.
- We show how these shocks contributed to a post-Covid feedback loop that intensified inflation.
- By linking weekly shocks to monthly inflation components up to the industry level, we find that global value chain disruptions generate the most persistent and broad-based price pressures, while energy and domestic supply shocks tend to produce more transitory effects, as their narrower inflationa

- This study investigates the impact of supervisory stress testing on banks’ behaviors and their systemic risk implications.
- Utilizing confidential supervisory data from the European Banking Authority’s EU-wide stress tests in 2021 and 2023, we employ a difference-in-differences framework to analyze how these exercises influence portfolio management decisions among European banks.
- This methodology allows us to compare stress-tested banks with similar non-tested institutions before and after the stress test events, isolating the effects specifically associated with the EU-wide assessments.
- Our findings reveal significant patterns of anticipatory behavior, with banks strategically window-dressing their capital ratios before stress tests begin.

- This paper investigates the economic impact of technological innovation, focusing on generative AI (GenAI) following ChatGPT’s release in November 2022.
- We propose a novel framework leveraging large language models to analyze earnings call transcripts.
- Our method quantifies firms’ GenAI exposure and classifies sentiment as opportunity, adoption, or risk.
- Using panel econometric techniques, we assess GenAI exposure’s impact on S&amp;P 500 firms’ financial performance over 2014-2023.

- The March 2023 banking turmoil has intensified discussions whether social media and the digitalisation of finance have become significant factors in driving severe deposit outflows.
- We introduce the concept of deposits-at-risk and utilize quantile regressions for disentangling determinants of stressed outflows at the lowest tail of the distribution.
- For a sample of large banks directly supervised by the ECB, our findings indicate that an increased use of online banking services leads to a small amplification of extreme deposit outflows, but this effect is not further exacerbated by the availability of a mobile banking app.
- Online banking use and availability of a mobile app do not have a causal effect on deposit volatility in normal times.

- Traditional exposure measures focus on direct exposures to evaluate the losses an institution is exposed to upon the default of a counterparty.
- Since the Global Financial Crisis of 2007-2008, the importance of indirect exposures via common asset holdings is increasingly recognized.
- Yet direct and indirect exposures do not to capture the losses that result from shock propagation and amplification following the counterparty's default.
- In this paper, we introduce the concept of \higher-order exposures" to refer to these spill-over losses and propose a way to formalize and quantify these.

- We employ a novel regional dataset on European private investment and business R&amp;D spanning the years 2000 to 2021, along with comprehensive historical data on European Union Structural and Investment (ESI) funds, to estimate whether ESIfunds have crowding-in or crowding-out effects on private investment and business R&amp;D.
- Our analysis, leveraging regional variation and a fiscal instrument immune to region-specific shocks, reveals a significant crowding-in effect, with 1 euro in ESI funds increasing private investment by 1.1 euros and business R&amp;D by 0.1 euros after two years.
- The effect is stronger in developed regions for private investment and in less developed regions for R&amp;D.
- Additionally, crowding-in effects are stronger in regions where corporate private debt
