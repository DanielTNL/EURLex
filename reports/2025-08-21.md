### Briefing (~200 words)

The key themes across the items [1], [2], and [3] focus on the EFTA Surveillance Authority's recommendation regarding ex ante regulation in the electronic communications sector, aligned with the European Electronic Communications Code (Directive (EU) 2018/1972). The recommendations identify specific product and service markets that will be subject to new regulatory obligations, impacting telecommunications providers and service operators within the EEA. The effective date of April 9, 2025, marks a significant timeline for compliance, necessitating that stakeholders assess their operations against the new framework.

In contrast, items [4] and [5] discuss advancements in econometric analysis, specifically in Bayesian structural vector autoregressions (VAR). They highlight the inadequacy of conventional pointwise quantiles in capturing uncertainty in impulse responses and propose new joint inference methods that yield wider error bands. These methods are shown to enhance the robustness of economic forecasts, particularly for inflation and GDP, by providing more reliable estimates of fiscal multipliers.

The implications of these findings suggest a need for regulatory adaptation in the electronic communications sector while also advocating for improved methodologies in economic analysis to ensure accurate forecasting and robust decision-making.
